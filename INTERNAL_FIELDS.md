# Internal Fields Documentation

## Status: No Internal Fields Added

During implementation, I followed the PRD specifications exactly without adding any extra internal fields beyond what's required.

### Model Fields (All Exposed in API)
- **Customer Model**: All fields from PRD are exposed in API responses
  - customer_id, first_name, last_name, age, phone_number
  - monthly_salary, approved_limit, monthly_income (for registration)

- **Loan Model**: All fields from PRD are exposed in API responses
  - loan_id, customer, loan_amount, tenure, interest_rate
  - monthly_repayment, emis_paid_on_time, repayments_left (calculated)

### Calculated Fields
- `repayments_left`: Calculated property (tenure - emis_paid_on_time) exposed in API
- `name`: Property combining first_name + last_name, exposed in registration response

### Database Indexes
Added standard Django auto-generated indexes. No custom internal fields created.

## Compliance
✅ No internal fields with `_` prefix were added
✅ All API responses contain only PRD-specified fields
✅ No internal technical fields exposed to clients
